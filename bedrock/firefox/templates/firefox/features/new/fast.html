{% block article_title %}Is Firefox the fastest browser?{% endblock %}

{% block article_content %}
<p>Every computer program you run takes up some memory. If your computer is low
  on memory, this can cause… a….. significant……....slow down.</p>

<h2>Multi-tasking with multiple tabs</h2>
<p>Firefox is a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and
  won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less lag time, you can switch quickly
  between tabs even when your little inner voice says you have waaay too many tabs open.</p>

<h2>Faster gaming</h2>
<p>Un-humble brag alert: We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds,
  and now Firefox is bringing even better performance to online gaming. Our
  powerful browser reduces lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall
  gameplay through faster, leaner browsing.</p>
